# GPU

G11P. Compute shaders run from the m1n1 proxy with `tools/gfx-proxy.py`. No
kernel driver yet.

## Firmware

`Firmware/agx/armfw_g11p.im4p`, a raw RTKit image. iBoot loads it as `gfxf`
only with a manifest that lists it, so `make ticket` fetches one and
`make images` wraps the firmware. iBoot then adds `segment-ranges` to
`/arm-io/gfx-asc`:

| segment | address | size | firmware VA |
|---|---|---|---|
| `__TEXT` | 0x800160000 | 0x44000 | 0 |
| `__DATA` | 0x8001a4000 | 0x8c000 | 0x44000 |

`linux-0019` adds `apple,asc-rtk`, which powers `ps_gfx`, sets RUN and runs the
RTKit handshake. The ASC has no DART.

The firmware cannot be restarted. Each proxy run needs a fresh DFU boot.

## Power

iBSS leaves GPU rails 2 (SRAM) and 4 (core) at 0, so any RGX access wedges the
coprocessor. Clear bits 10 and 12 of 0x23b0a0000 and the rails follow the GPU
DVFS table at 0x23b070000. `m1n1-0012` does this for Linux boots.

## Init block

EP 0x20, `0x81 << 48 | addr`, points at u64s:

| index | what |
|---|---|
| 3 | RegionB |
| 4 | RegionC |
| 5 | firmware mem-desc ring |
| 6 to 0x12 | MMU format |
| 0x13, 0x14 | mem-desc table, count |

Mem-desc entries are `u64 va, u32 pa >> 12, u32 0, u16 16K pages, u16 flags`.

RegionB has 17 channels (12 run queues, device control, event, firmware log,
KTrace, stats), stats at 0x170 to 0x180, hwdata A and B at 0x188 and 0x1a0.

| hwdata B | what |
|---|---|
| 0x0 | VA bases: 0x14 << 32, 0xffc00000, 0x11 << 32, 0x11 << 32, 0x18ffff8000 |
| 0x640 + 0x20 n | IO maps: Fender 0x204d00000, RGX 0x204000000 |
| 0x958, 0x960 | real power mode |
| 0x988 | power sample period, 24 MHz ticks |
| 0xa6c | highest pstate |
| 0xa70 on | perf state tables |
| 0x16d0 | unit masks for TA, 3D, CP: 3, 7, 1 |

| RegionC | what |
|---|---|
| 0x0 | KTrace categories, 0xff for all |
| 0x9150 | per-context TLB generation |
| 0x9158 | per-context page catalogue address |
| 0x9160 on | contexts loaded at every power-up, 32 per word |
| 0xb198 | set by the firmware when init is done |
| 0xb1cc | 1, so the first power-up installs the job handlers |

## MMU

A PowerVR Rogue S7 MMU, registers 0x8ef0 above Rogue's.

| RGX | what |
|---|---|
| 0x17030 | context index |
| 0x17038 | page catalogue address >> 12 |
| 0x17040 | fault status |

16K pages, 40 bit VA:

| level | VA bits | entry |
|---|---|---|
| page catalogue | 39:30 | u32, `(pd >> 12) << 4 \| 1` |
| page directory | 29:21 | u64, `pt \| 3` |
| page table | 20:14 | u64, `page \| 1`, bit 1 read-only |

User VMs use contexts 16 to 63. The low ones belong to the parameter manager:
a job in context 1 faults as "PM client access out of range".

Fault status: VA bits 63:24, context 21:16, requestor 15:8 (3 is CDM), level
6:5, read bit 4, type 3:1.

## Jobs

| what | channel | doorbell |
|---|---|---|
| device control | 12 | `0x83 << 48 \| 0x11` |
| run queue | 0 to 11 | `0x83 << 48 \| channel` |

A compute command (type 3, 0x2e0 bytes):

| offset | what |
|---|---|
| 0x10 | context |
| 0x14 | event control |
| 0x70 | values for RGX 0x14020, 0x14000 (CDM stream), 0x118d0 |
| 0x1f0 | microsequence |
| 0x278 | completion stamp |

Microsequence:

| op | bytes | what |
|---|---|---|
| 0x29 | 0x64 | start compute and kick |
| 0x41 | 4 | wait for the CDM interrupt |
| 0x2a | 0x44 | finalize |
| 0x18 | 4 | end, writes the stamp |

## Compute

CDM block types in bits 31:30: 0 launch, 2 terminate (0x80000000), 3 barrier
(0xc0000160). A direct launch is 8 words:

```text
header
state block address | low bits
global size x, y, z, in threads
threadgroup size x, y, z
```

| header bits | what |
|---|---|
| 0 | always set; at 0 every odd threadgroup is dropped |
| 3:1 | uniform registers, blocks of 32, mod 8 |
| 8:4 | texture states |
| 11:9 | sampler states |

The state block is 64 byte aligned. Its low bits: 5:2 registers in blocks of
8 (0 is 16), 1:0 state block length in 64 bytes.

The state block is a list of words:

```text
u64 3 | first << 9 | count << 21 | va << 24     uniform load, u0 on, up to 31
u64 (code >> 6) << 38 | 0x90000000 | 0x1f       shader, 8 registers
u16 0x0108                                      no preshader
```

The uniform address is the full GPU VA. The code address is a 32 bit offset
from 0x11 << 32.

The ISA is close to G13. The iOS CoreImage binary archives hold G11 kernels
(GPU Mach-O, cpusubtype 0x72), and applegpu's G13 disassembler reads nearly all
of them. Stop is `0x0801`.

Kernels that ran:

| kernel | what |
|---|---|
| `mov_imm`, `device_store` | 0xcafe1234 to memory |
| `get_sr` sr80, `device_store` at a register offset | `out[tid] = tid`, 256 threads |
| `iadd` with `u2`, store based at `u0_u1` | uniforms |

A store's register offset is scaled by the element size.

## Queues

Several commands can go through one queue in one firmware session. The run
message is `{type, info, head, queue index, flush}`. The firmware stores head
at info+0x28 and runs the ring from its read index up to it. The next command
goes in the next ring entry with head + 1.
